# DualSMC
This is the PyTorch code for the following paper to be presented at IJCAI-20, in which we proposed a deep model for POMDPs planning.

**DualSMC: Tunneling Differentiable Filtering and Planning under Continuous POMDPs** by Yunbo Wang*, Bo Liu*, Jiajun Wu, Yuke Zhu, Simon S. Du, Li Fei-Fei, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum. (* indicates equal contributions)

We currently release the code for the first experimental domain, the **floor positioning**. The rest of the code for the 3D light-dark navigation domain and the modified Reacher domain will be released later. All experiments are reproducible.
